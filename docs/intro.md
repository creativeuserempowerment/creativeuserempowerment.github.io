# Creative User Empowerment

The Creative User Empowerment project works on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for museums.

The Creative User Empowerment (CUE) project is is a partnership between the [Baden State Museum](https://www.landesmuseum.de/) (Karlsruhe) and [Allard Pierson Museum](https://allardpierson.nl/) (Amsterdam). CUE aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock museum heritage collections via an Open Source tool called xCurator.
